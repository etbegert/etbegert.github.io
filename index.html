I am working to get involved in volunteering and developing for the Fedora Project and Mozilla.</pre>
        <My>hobbies include hiking, gaming (both board and video games), tennis, Arduino, and more. I am involved in trailbuilding for the WTA in Washington. The WTA, Washington Trails Association, is involved in keeping up various nature trails, hiking paths, and other nature conservancy in Washington state.</My>
        <I>have worked in a teaching position where I taught programming to elementary through high school ages, and am very passionate about teaching programming and spreading knowledge to the next generation of coders. It is my goal to continue volunteering in this manner whenever possible to continue spreading education and computer literacy.</I>
